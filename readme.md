## BIPN 162 (Neural Data Science) is a project-based course in which students will use computational notebooks to perform exploratory data analyses and to test hypotheses in large neuroscience datasets, including the differences between unique neuron types, leveraging text mining of the neuroscience literature, and human neuroimaging analyses.
Prerequisites: MATH 11 and BIPN 100.

## In this course, you'll learn how to
* Write and edit Python code, particularly in Jupyter Notebooks
* Develop hypotheses specific to big data environments in neuroscience
* Design a big data experiment and excavate data from open sources

## Don't know how to code?

# That's okay, and <i>expected.</i>

## This course is designed for new coders.

## Know how to code?

### That's also okay. There is endless complexity to these datasets, and lots of code to write.
