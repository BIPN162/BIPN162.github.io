<b>BIPN 162 (Neural Data Science)</b> is a project-based course in which students will use computational notebooks to perform exploratory data analyses and to test hypotheses in large neuroscience datasets, including the <a href="https://portal.brain-map.org/">differences between unique neuron types</a>, <a href="https://lisc-tools.github.io/lisc/index.html">text mining of the neuroscience literature</a>, and <a href="https://neurosynth.org/">human neuroimaging analyses</a>.

### We'll address the following questions:
* What do the different cell types and circuits in the brain <i>do</i>?
* How do we link genes, circuits, and behavior?
* And can we use open source data to answer these questions?

### In this course, you'll learn how to:
* Write and edit Python code, particularly in Jupyter Notebooks
* Develop hypotheses specific to big data environments in neuroscience
* Design a big data experiment and excavate data from open sources
* Integrate data from multiple datasets to answer a biological question

## FAQs

### I don't know how to code! Can I take this course?
That's okay, and <i>expected.</i> This course is designed for new coders. If you already know how to code, that's also okay. There is endless complexity to these datasets, and lots of code to write.

### I'm missing a prerequisite, is that okay?
The prerequisites for this course are <b>MATH 11</b> (Introductory Probability & Statistics) & <b>BIPN 100</b> (Human Physiology). We'll rely on a basic understanding of brain regions and the activity of neurons. We'll also be applying principles of statistics to the data. If you think you have enough background in these topics, <a href="https://biology.ucsd.edu/education/undergrad/course/prereq.html">file a waiver.</a>

### How much work will this course be?
Like all 4-unit courses at UCSD, this course will meet for 4 hours (T/Th, with discussion sections Friday; <a href="https://act.ucsd.edu/scheduleOfClasses/scheduleOfClassesStudent.htm">Schedule of Classes</a>) and will assign work (including reviewing lecture material) amounting to about 6-8 hours of work outside of class. Each week you will complete a coding problem set that will help you develop the skills you need to work with our datasets. In addition, there will be 2 or 3 bigger projects to complete throughout the course.

### I'm a biology major. Why should I care about coding?
Programming and data science skills are increasingly useful in biology and <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/a-neural-data-science-how-and-why-d7e3969086f2">neuroscience in particular</a>. The ability to code will enable you to acquire, analyze, and visualize your data. Plus, coding is quite useful beyond biology -- why not learn while looking at brains?

### Is this course open to graduate students?
Yes! I'll just ask that you complete a bonus small project for graduate credit.

### Who's teaching this course?
In Winter 2020, this course is being taught by Dr. Ashley Juavinett. I'm developing the course with Dr. Brad Voytek (Cognitive Science) who will be teaching a COGS version of the course in the future.
