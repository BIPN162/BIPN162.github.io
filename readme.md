## What do the different cell types and circuits in the brain <i>do</i>?
## How do we link genes, circuits, and behavior?
## And can we use open source data to answer these questions?

BIPN 162 (Neural Data Science) is a project-based course in which students will use computational notebooks to perform exploratory data analyses and to test hypotheses in large neuroscience datasets, including the <a href="https://portal.brain-map.org/">differences between unique neuron types</a>, <a href="https://lisc-tools.github.io/lisc/index.html">text mining of the neuroscience literature</a>, and <a href="https://neurosynth.org/">human neuroimaging analyses</a>.

### In this course, you'll learn how to
* Write and edit Python code, particularly in Jupyter Notebooks
* Develop hypotheses specific to big data environments in neuroscience
* Design a big data experiment and excavate data from open sources

### Don't know how to code?
That's okay, and <i>expected.</i> This course is designed for new coders.

### Know how to code?
That's also okay. There is endless complexity to these datasets, and lots of code to write.

### Prerequisites
<b>MATH 11</b> (Introductory Probability & Statistics) & <b>BIPN 100</b> (Human Physiology).
This course will rely on a basic understanding of brain regions and the activity of neurons. We'll also be applying principles of statistics to the data. If you think you have enough background in these topics, <a href="https://biology.ucsd.edu/education/undergrad/course/prereq.html">file a waiver.</a>
