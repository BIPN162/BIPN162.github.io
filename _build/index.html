<p><b>BIPN 162 (Neural Data Science)</b> is a project-based course in which students will use computational notebooks to perform exploratory data analyses and to test hypotheses in large neuroscience datasets, including the <a href="https://portal.brain-map.org/">differences between unique neuron types</a>, <a href="https://lisc-tools.github.io/lisc/index.html">text mining of the neuroscience literature</a>, and <a href="https://neurosynth.org/">human neuroimaging analyses</a>.</p>

<h3 id="We'll-address-the-following-questions:">We'll address the following questions:<a class="anchor-link" href="#We'll-address-the-following-questions:"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>What do the different cell types and circuits in the brain <i>do</i>?</li>
<li>How do we link genes, circuits, and behavior?</li>
<li>And can we use open source data to answer these questions?</li>

<h2 id="FAQs">FAQs<a class="anchor-link" href="#FAQs"> </a></h2><h3 id="I-don't-know-how-to-code!-Can-I-take-this-course?">I don't know how to code! Can I take this course?<a class="anchor-link" href="#I-don't-know-how-to-code!-Can-I-take-this-course?"> </a></h3><p>That's okay, and <i>expected.</i> This course is designed for new coders. If you already know how to code, that's also okay. There is endless complexity to these datasets, and lots of code to write.</p>
<h3 id="I'm-missing-a-prerequisite,-is-that-okay?">I'm missing a prerequisite, is that okay?<a class="anchor-link" href="#I'm-missing-a-prerequisite,-is-that-okay?"> </a></h3><p>The prerequisites for this course are <b>MATH 11</b> (Introductory Probability &amp; Statistics) &amp; <b>BIPN 100</b> (Human Physiology). We'll rely on a basic understanding of brain regions and the activity of neurons. We'll also be applying principles of statistics to the data. If you think you have enough background in these topics, <a href="https://biology.ucsd.edu/education/undergrad/course/prereq.html">file a waiver.</a></p>
<h3 id="How-much-work-will-this-course-be?">How much work will this course be?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-much-work-will-this-course-be?"> </a></h3><p>Like all 4-unit courses at UCSD, this course will meet for 4 hours (T/Th, with discussion sections Friday; <a href="https://act.ucsd.edu/scheduleOfClasses/scheduleOfClassesStudent.htm">Schedule of Classes</a>) and will assign work (including reviewing lecture material) amounting to about 6-8 hours of work outside of class. Each week you will complete a coding problem set that will help you develop the skills you need to work with our datasets. In addition, there will be 2 slightly larger projects to complete towards the end of the course.</p>
<h3 id="I'm-a-biology-major.-Why-should-I-care-about-coding?">I'm a biology major. Why should I care about coding?<a class="anchor-link" href="#I'm-a-biology-major.-Why-should-I-care-about-coding?"> </a></h3><p>Programming and data science skills are increasingly useful in biology and <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/a-neural-data-science-how-and-why-d7e3969086f2">neuroscience in particular</a>. The ability to code will enable you to acquire, analyze, and visualize your data. Plus, coding is quite useful beyond biology -- why not learn while looking at brains?</p>
<h3 id="Is-this-course-open-to-graduate-students?">Is this course open to graduate students?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Is-this-course-open-to-graduate-students?"> </a></h3><p>Yes! The code is BGGN 240. I'll ask that you complete a bonus assignment for graduate credit.</p>
<h3 id="Who's-teaching-this-course?">Who's teaching this course?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Who's-teaching-this-course?"> </a></h3><p>In Winter and Summer 2020, this course is being taught by Dr. Ashley Juavinett. I'm developing the course with Dr. Brad Voytek (Cognitive Science) who will be teaching a COGS version of the course in the future.</p>
